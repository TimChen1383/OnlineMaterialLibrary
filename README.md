# OnlineMaterialLibrary (WIP. Temporary name)
Due to the shader language and the node based design of the game engine, materials are hard to share across multiple platforms. Which means you can't see it on web browser, hard to shader with other people an the material can only be use in single platform like Unreal Engine.

This platform is based on Slang(https://shader-slang.org/), which supports multiple backend targets for portable code deployment across diverse APIs and platforms.
It cludes features below:
- Code based. Based on the industry standard shader language Slang
- Write once and server will compile to code for multiple platforms
- Can be converted and demostrate in realtime through Web Browser
- Can be converted and export to game engine like Unreal Engine and Unity
- Storing ready to use materials as library on the platform
- Easy to share with other people
