Request
================================================================================
I want to create a website which can demostrate shader in real-time.
Ideally it's like the mixture of SketchFab and ShaderToy.
However no need to be as complex as SketchFab or ShaderToy.

It's like a library. 
User can choose to demostrate the material on sphere, cube or plane mesh.
User can rotate the mesh around to see the shader details.
I guess this part will be done through three.js.

About the shader, no need to be as complex as ShaderToy.
No custom fancy function.
Just let user input GLSL code and we can see the result in realtime on the chosen mesh.
If user is happy with the result, he can choose to export the code as GLSL or HLSL.

The idea is came from my previous Unreal Engine Material Library project.
I collected a lot of cool material together and add the screenshots of the material to the github page.
Although it's called library, but I can't see the result in real-time.
Becuse it's just an image.
Also if the material has some moving effect, we can't see the effect through single image as well.

Unreal Engine's material is written in HLSL.
As I know, for better performance and demostation on website, we should use WebGL and GLSL.
That's the reason we need a converter.
We demostrate the shader effect in GLSL on web browser.
We can choose to export the code as HLSL and user can use it directly inside Unreal Engine.
I want the result in GLSL to be as similar as possible in HLSL.

I have heard that tool like "SPIRV-Cross" and "Slang" from Khronos may be the solution of converter.
Also there is something called "Monaco Editor" can help me on code input.

As I don't know much about creating this kind of website, can you give me a plan first?
Convert my request into a technical plan.
Is there any templates/tools/packages that realted to this request?
No need to start from scratch.
Achieve the goal is more important than show off the technical skill.
